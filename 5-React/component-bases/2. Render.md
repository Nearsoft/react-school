# `render`

`render` is one method that we have already encountered. `render` is part of the lifecycle methods of React, which we'll see more on later.

The `render()` method is the only required method in a class component.

When called, it should examine `this.props` and `this.state` and return one of the following types:

- React elements. Typically created via JSX. For example, <div /> and <MyComponent /> are React elements that instruct React to render a DOM node, or another user-defined component, respectively.
- Arrays and fragments. Let you return multiple elements from render.
- Portals. Let you render children into a different DOM subtree. See the documentation on portals for more details.
- String and numbers. These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.
- Booleans or null. Render nothing. (Mostly exists to support return test && <Child /> pattern, where test is boolean.)

```jsx harmony
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>ToDo App</h1>
        <ToDoInput value="Hola" className="todo-input" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

The `render` function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time itâ€™s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.
This means that no call to `this.setState` should me made in this method, as this would:
1) Break with the pattern of the method being pure.
2) Could trigger an infinite loop of the component trying to render.
