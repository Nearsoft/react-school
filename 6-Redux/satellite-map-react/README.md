# Satellite Map React

## N2YO REST API Configuration

The project requires a [n2yo.com](https://www.n2yo.com) API key. You can create an account [here](https://www.n2yo.com/login/register/).
After registering and log in, you can generate your API key [here](https://www.n2yo.com/login/edit/).

**This key should be added to your local `.env` file under the `REACT_APP_N2YO_KEY` property.**

Full API documentation is available here: https://www.n2yo.com/api/.

__The purpose of this exercise is to migrate the project to use [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) and [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/).__
