### Generators
Regular functions return only one, single value (or nothing).

Generators can return (“yield”) multiple values, possibly an infinite number of values, one after another, on-demand. They work great with  iterables,  allowing to create data streams with ease.

To create a generator, we need a special syntax construct:  `function*`, so-called “generator function”.

It looks like this:
```javascript
function* numeros(total){
  let num = 0;
  while(num <total){
    yield num;
    num++;
  }
}

for(let n of numeros(10)){
  console.log(n)
}
```
The value on generators are calculated as we demand it.
