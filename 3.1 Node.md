### REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
Once you installed Node.js, it comes with an interactive shell. Go to your terminal and type `node`

```shell

```

Here is where you can play with Node.js and JavaScript.

```shell
> 1 + 1
2
> 'React School'
'React School'
> const sum = (a, b) => a + b
undefined
>
```

Try to type `.help`, you will see something like:

```shell
.break    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
.clear    Alias for .break
.editor   Enter editor mode
.exit     Exit the repl
.help     Print this help message
.load     Load JS from a file into the REPL session
.save     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file
```
